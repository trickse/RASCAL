My name is Therron Ricks! I am a new Square Dance caller coming to the RoR community with a jack background in computer programming, like 9 credit hours really. I've been calling Square Dance for 5 years now and want to see the calls utilized in a better way that helps new dancers learn and old dancers stay engauged and refreshed.
